utsthesis
=========

A class file that extends the titlepage command in hepthesis so that it can be used in UTS submissions. It also adds the uts logo in the header, and provides an info table that you can fill up with your enrollment details.

Usage
-----
To use this instead of including the class hepthesis, include this class utsthesis. It loads the hepthesis class and redefines the \titlepage command. It's a rather small file and you can modify it as you see fit.

The titlepage command can then be used like this:

\titlepage{Student ID}{University of Technology, Sydney}{Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology}{Center for autonomous systems}{Principal supervisor}{Alternate supervisor}{Course start date}{Course EWS date}{Assessment date}
